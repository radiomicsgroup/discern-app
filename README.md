# DISCERN: Diagnosis In Susceptibility Contrast Enhancing Regions for Neuroncology

The app uses a pretrained CNN classifier scheme for voxel-wise classification of enhancing brain tumours into P-CNS-lymphoma, glioblastoma or brain metastasis, from dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI data.

This is the code repository of the brain tumour classification pipeline described in the work [*An accessible deep learning tool for voxel-wise classification of brain malignancies from perfusion MRI*](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2362207/v1) (preprint) by Raquel Perez-Lopez and colleagues from the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), Barcelona, Spain.


The app will be running in our servers on [link.](http://84.88.64.102:5000/discern-app)

## Requirements
### Python
- Python 3.8
- Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`
- Optionally, to handle compressed DICOMs: pydicom (2.1.2 tested), gdcm (2.8.9 tested)

### External
#### 3D Slicer 4.8.1

- [windows](https://slicer-packages.kitware.com/api/v1/file/60add7aeae4540bf6a89c0eb/download)

- [mac](https://slicer-packages.kitware.com/api/v1/file/60add78bae4540bf6a89c0c4/download)

- [linux](https://slicer-packages.kitware.com/api/v1/file/60add79eae4540bf6a89c0d6/download)

#### dcm2niix

- [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix)

### NOTE
- If used without graphical interface in a Linux system, xvfb-run is needed (`sudo apt install xvfb`)

## Installation
Download or clone this repository as follows, and navigate into the new folder /discern-app:

`git clone https://github.com/radiomicsgroup/discern-app`

You may create a new Python environment, we will use anaconda/miniconda:

`conda create --name myenv python=3.8`

`conda activate myenv`

Install python packages specified in the file requirements.txt from the discern-app folder:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Optionally:

`pip install pydicom==2.1.2`

`pip install gdcm==2.8.9`

Download Slicer from above links and unpack/install in /discern-app/programs

Download dcm2niix from above links and unpack/install in /discern-app/programs

In `settings.py`, place the path of Slicer like: `SLICER_ROOT="/discern-app/programs/Slicer-4.8.1-linux-amd64"`

In `settings.py`, place the path of dcm2niix executable like: `DCM2NIIX="/discern-app/programs/dcm2niix/dcm2niix"`

## Usage
To run the pipeline, call `python run.py`:

`python run.py --p_dsc /path_to_DSC_image --p_t1 /path_to_T1_image --p_output /desired_output_path`

Input DSC and T1wCE volumes may be in DICOM, Nifti or NRRD formats.
Segmentation mask files can be provided instead of the T1 volume.

See all the options in the docstring help with `python run.py --help`.
